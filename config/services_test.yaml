    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias
    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,
    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:
    #
    test.sms_gateway_me: '@App\Service\SmsGatewayMe'
    test.twilio: '@App\Service\Twilio'
    test.edw_api: '@Edw\Service\EdwApi'
    test.edw_api_go4hr_contact: '@Edw\Service\Go4hr\Contact'
